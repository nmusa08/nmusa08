### Educational/ Career Background
I have recently graduated from a Biological Science degree from the University of Calgary. I am currently a volunteer research assistant working on different studies on healh issues in children. 


### Experience with technology 
I have limited experience working with technology as this is my first class related to coding. I am excited to learn and see how it applies to different fields.
